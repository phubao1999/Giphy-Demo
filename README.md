# GiphyDemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Note

I just have about 4 days to working with this coding test so a lot of `Unit Test` that haven't done.
About Upload Gif Api to `Giphy`. I have a trouble when I try to upload gif local file. It's return a CORS error and can be resolve if you have a production api key. But you can test this feature if you use gif via `URL Link`.
If I have more time to doing this coding test. I will:
- Update more `Unit Test` and make sure it will coverage more than 80% for this application.
- Create Dark mode can make this application more fit and beautiful for other end user if they prefer dark theme.
- Optimize the way HTTP calling for better performance and UX if possible.
- Try to split component or popup modal for more easy to maintain this app later on.
